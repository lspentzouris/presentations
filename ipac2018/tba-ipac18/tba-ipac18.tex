\begin{abstract}
Two beam acceleration is a candidate for future high energy physics machines and FEL user facilities. 
This scheme consists of two independent electron beam lines operating synchronously. 
High-charge, 70 MeV drive bunch trains are injected from the rf photoinjector into
decelerating structures to generate a few hundred MW of rf power. 
This rf power is transferred through an rf waveguide to accelerating structures that are used to
accelerate the witness beam. Staging refers to the sequential acceleration (energy gain) 
in two or more structures on the witness beam line. A kicker was incorporated on the 
drive beam line to accomplish a modular design so that each accelerating structure 
can be independently powered by a separate drive beam. 
Simulations were performed in OPAL-T to model the two beam lines. 
Beam sizes at the center of the structures was minimized to ensure good charge transmission. 
\textcolor{red}{Dispersion was minimized for bunches traveling through the kicker and dipoles.} 
The resulting design will be the basis for proof of principle experiments that will take place 
at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility.
\end{abstract}


\section{AWA Facility}
The AWA facility houses two rf photoinjectors
operating at \SI{1.3}{GHz}. 
The bunch charge is routinely adjusted for depending on the requirements 
of the experiments downstream of the photoinjector.
Typical operating charges are 1, 4, 10, and \SI{40}{nC}. 
While these are the most
common operating modes, other charges have been requested 
and provided depending on the experiment.
Recent experiments include emittance exchange \cite{eex}, 
structure tests \cite{pets}, thermal emittance measurements \cite{therm}, 
and two beam acceleration \cite{tba} (TBA), which is the subject of this proceeding. 

\section{Two Beam Acceleration Layout}
The AWA facility lends well to TBA experiments due to the 
close proximity of both operational photoinjectors. 
They are housed in the same bunker and located about two meters apart.
This number slightly varies depending on which part of the beam 
lines you are comparing. For the remainder of this paper, we will
refer to the low charge beam line as the "witness" line, 
and the high charge, beam line as the "drive" line.
While the charge on each line can be varied, for TBA experiments, 
the witness line is operated at \SI{1}{nC} and the drive line
is operated at \SI{40}{nC}.

The planned TBA layout is shown in Fig.~\ref{beamline}.
The drive line has six accelerating 
cavities with a maximum beam energy of \SI{70}{MeV}. 
The witness line has accelerating cavity with a max beam energy of \SI{15}{MeV}.
The guns are located at opposite ends of the bunker and 
the propagation direction of the beam lines are opposing.
The witness line is operated in single bunch mode, and 
the drive line supplies high charge bunch trains. 
The planned experiments will include trains of eight bunches
with about \SI{40}{nC} in each bunch.

The high charge bunch trains are supplied to Power Extraction
and Transfer Structures (PETS) downstream. These are decelerating 
structures that extract power from the bunches through wakefield generation.
The structures advantage of superposition and allow the wake from each 
There are two decelerating stages on the drive line, and two 
corresponding accelerating sections on the witness line.
The accelerating structures, ACC$_1$ and ACC$_2$, are only 
powered by the PETS on the drive line. 

The kicker will be supplied 
by a fast rise time pulsar.

\section{Kicker Test}
The fast rise time kicker was especially fabricated 
for this experiment. The initial design was adapted from 
work done at NIU \cite{kicker}. The plates were lengthened
to increase the

\section{Ongoing Optimization}
Simulations of the AWA beam line shown in Fig~\ref{beamline}
were performed in the PIC codes IMPACT~\cite{impact} and OPAL~\cite{opal}.
The gun, accelerating cavities, and solenoids were modeled with 2D
Poisson/Superfish~\cite{fish} files. All field maps were in the T7 format.
Input parameters for the simulations are shown in Table~\ref{simparam}.
Note that on crest refers to the phase of max energy gain.
In the case of the gun, a -~$20^{\circ}$ phase is measured 
w.r.t the phase of max energy gain. 
In other words, we ran $-20^{\circ}$ off crest.

\section{Conclusion}
The TBA layout for upcoming experiments at the 
AWA facility is decided. A fast rise time kicker
was designed and fabricated. Initial optimization 
work has been done in simulations to decide operating 
optics parameters for the high charge drive line.
Additional optimization studies will be done 
to finalize the optics further downstream.
