\begin{abstract}
Two beam acceleration is a candidate for future high energy physics machines and FEL user facilities. This scheme consists of two independent electron
beam lines operating synchronously. High-charge, 70 MeV drive bunch trains are injected from the RF photo-injector into decelerating structures to
generate a few hundred of MW of RF power. This RF power is transferred through an RF waveguide to accelerating structures that are used to
accelerate the witness beam. Staging refers to the sequential acceleration (energy gain) in two or more structures on the witness beam line. A kicker
was incorporated on the drive beam line to accomplish a modular design so that each accelerating structure can be independently powered by a
separate drive beam. Simulations were performed in OPAL-T to model the two beam lines. Beam sizes at the center of the structures was minimized to
ensure good charge transmission. Dispersion was minimized for bunches traveling through the kicker and dipoles. The resulting design will be the basis
for proof of principle experiments that will take place at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility.
\end{abstract}


\section{AWA Facility}
The AWA Facility houses two rf photoinjectors, both 
operating at \SI{1.3}{GHz}. The photoinjector used for 
these studies consists of a gun and solenoids followed
by six accelerating cavities, as shown in Fig.~\ref{beamline}. 
This beam line is capable of low (\SI{0.1}{nC}) and 
high charge (\SI{100}{nC}) operation. The bunch charge is 
routinely adjusted for depending on the requirements 
of the experiments downstream of the photoinjector.
Typical operating charges are 1, 4, 10, and \SI{40}{nC}. 
While these are the most
common operating modes, other charges have been requested 
and provided depending on the experiment.
Recent experiments include emittance exchange \cite{eex}, 
structure tests \cite{pets}, thermal emittance measurements \cite{therm}, 
and two beam acceleration \cite{tba}. 


\section{Kicker Tests}


\section{Simulations}
Simulations of the AWA beam line shown in Fig~\ref{beamline}
were performed in the PIC codes IMPACT~\cite{impact} and OPAL~\cite{opal}.
The gun, accelerating cavities, and solenoids were modeled with 2D
Poisson/Superfish~\cite{fish} files. All field maps were in the T7 format.
Input parameters for the simulations are shown in Table~\ref{simparam}.
Note that on crest refers to the phase of max energy gain.
In the case of the gun, a -~$20^{\circ}$ phase is measured 
w.r.t the phase of max energy gain. 
In other words, we ran $-20^{\circ}$ off crest.
