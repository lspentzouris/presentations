\headerbox{AWA Facility}{name=problem,column=0,row=0, span=2}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The AWA facility houses two rf photoinjectors
operating at \SI{1.3}{GHz}. 
The bunch charge is routinely adjusted for depending on the requirements 
of the experiments downstream of the photoinjector.
Typical operating charges are 1, 4, 10, and \SI{40}{nC}. 
While these are the most
common operating modes, other charges have been requested 
and provided depending on the experiment.
Recent experiments include emittance exchange \cite{eex}, 
high gradient structure tests \cite{pets}, thermal emittance measurements \cite{therm}, 
and two beam acceleration \cite{tba} (TBA), which is the subject of this proceeding. 
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{hold}{name=sims,column=2,row=0,span=2}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The AWA facility lends well to TBA experiments due to the 
close proximity of both operational photoinjectors. 
They are located in the same bunker and located about two meters apart.
This number slightly varies depending on which part of the beam 
lines you are comparing. For the remainder of this paper, we will
refer to the low charge beam line as the "witness" line, 
and the high charge, beam line as the "drive" line.
While the charge on each line can be varied, for TBA experiments, 
the witness line is operated at \SI{1}{nC} and the drive line
is operated at \SI{40}{nC}.

The planned TBA layout is shown in Fig.~\ref{beamline}.
The drive line has six accelerating 
cavities with a maximum beam energy of \SI{70}{MeV}. 
The witness line has accelerating cavity with a max beam energy of \SI{15}{MeV}.
The guns are located at opposite ends of the bunker and 
the propagation direction of the beam lines are opposing.
The witness line is operated in single bunch mode, and 
the drive line supplies high charge bunch trains. 
The planned experiments will include trains of eight bunches
with about \SI{40}{nC} in each bunch.

The arrow at the end of each line indicates what direction the beam is traveling.
PETS stands for Power Extraction and Transfer Structure, and ACC stands for Accelerating structure. 
The subscript index on each structure refers to which stage the structures belong to, first or second stage. 
There are six accelerating cavities on the drive line, and only one accelerating cavity on the witness line.
