\headerbox{AWA Facility}{name=problem,column=0,row=0, span=2}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The AWA facility houses two rf photoinjectors
operating at \SI{1.3}{GHz}. 
The bunch charge is routinely adjusted for depending on the requirements 
of the experiments downstream of the photoinjector.
Typical operating charges are 1, 4, 10, and \SI{40}{nC}. 
While these are the most
common operating modes, other charges have been requested 
and provided depending on the experiment.
Recent experiments include emittance exchange \cite{eex}, 
high gradient structure tests \cite{pets}, thermal emittance measurements \cite{therm}, 
and two beam acceleration \cite{tba} (TBA). 
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Introduction}{name=sims,column=2,row=0,span=2}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The AWA facility lends well to TBA experiments due to the 
close proximity of both operational photoinjectors. 
They are located in the same bunker and located about two meters apart.
The low charge beam line is refeered to as the "witness" line, 
and the high charge, beam line as the "drive" line.
For TBA experiments, the witness line is operated at \SI{1}{nC} 
and the drive line is operated at \SI{40}{nC} per bunch.
The witness line is operated in single bunch mode, and 
the drive line supplies high charge bunch trains. 

 
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Staging}{name=hold,column=4,row=0,span=2,}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The kicker will ensure that one bunch train is supplied to 
each stage. This allows for more energy transfer in stage 2.
If the same bunch train supplies both stages \cite{tba}, the amount
of available energy for stage 2 would be decreased by the 
amount of energy deposited in stage 1. This would cause
unequal energy gain in each stage.
After passing the kicker, 
the high charge bunch trains are supplied to Power Extraction
and Transfer Structures (PETS) downstream. These are decelerating 
structures that extract power from the bunches through wakefield generation.
The structures take advantage of superposition and allow the wake from each 
bunch to combine to the others. A high power pulse is generated by 
the combination of wakes and transfered through a waveguide to the 
witness line. 
There are two decelerating stages on the drive line, and two 
corresponding accelerating sections on the witness line.
The accelerating structures, ACC$_1$ and ACC$_2$, are only 
powered by the PETS on the drive line. There is no  
external power source.

The arrow at the end of each line indicates what direction the beam is traveling.
The guns are located at opposite ends of the bunker and 
the propagation direction of the beam lines are opposing.
PETS stands for Power Extraction and Transfer Structure, and ACC stands for Accelerating structure. 
The subscript index on each structure refers to which stage the structures belong to, first or second stage. 
The drive line has six accelerating 
cavities with a maximum beam energy of \SI{70}{MeV}. 
The witness line has accelerating cavity with a max beam energy of \SI{15}{MeV}.

The first accelerating stage refers to portions of the beam line that 
support ACC$_1$, and PEST$_1$. This is the straight 
through portion of the drive beam line. The first bunch train will be allowed
to pass the kicker when it is unactivated, i.e. not pulse and no field present.
The bunch train will then arrive at the quadrupoles before PETS$_1$. 
Focusing will ensure maximum transmission of the \SI{40}{nC} 
bunch train through PEST$_1$. Integrated Current Transformers (ICT's), 
are located before and after all PETS and ACC structures to monitor the 
transmission.
