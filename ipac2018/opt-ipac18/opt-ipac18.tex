\begin{abstract}
With a variable charge range of 0.1 nC - 100 nC, 
the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility (AWA) 
has a unique and dynamic set of operating parameters. 
Adjustment of the optics and occasionally the rf phases is 
required each time the bunch charge is changed. 
Presently, these adjustments are done by the operator during each experiment. 
This is time consuming and inefficient, more so at high charge and for complex experimental set ups.
In an attempt to reduce the amount of time spent adjusting parameters by hand, 
several optimization methods in simulation are being explored. 
This includes using the well-known Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II),
incorporated into OPAL-T. 
We have also investigated a model-based method and novel
structure based algorithms developed at ANL. 
Ongoing efforts include using these optimization methods to improve operations at the AWA. 
Simulation results will be compared to measured beam parameters at the AWA, 
and one optimization method will be selected for use in guiding operations going forward.
\end{abstract}


\section{AWA Facility}
The AWA Facility houses two rf photoinjectors, both 
operating at \SI{1.3}{GHz}. The photoinjector used for 
these studies consists of a gun and solenoids followed
by six accelerating cavities, as shown in Fig.~\ref{beamline}. 
This beam line is capable of low (\SI{0.1}{nC}) and 
high charge (\SI{100}{nC}) operation. The bunch charge is 
routinely adjusted for depending on the requirements 
of the experiments downstream of the photoinjector.
Typical operating charges are 1, 4, 10, and \SI{40}{nC}. 
While these are the most
common operating modes, other charges have been requested 
and provided depending on the experiment.
Recent experiments include emittance exchange \cite{eex}, 
structure tests \cite{pets}, thermal emittance measurements \cite{therm}, 
and two beam acceleration \cite{tba}. 

\section{Simulations}
Simulations of the AWA beam line shown in Fig~\ref{beamline}
were performed in the PIC codes OPAL~\cite{opal}.
The gun, accelerating cavities, and solenoids were modeled with 2D
Poisson/Superfish~\cite{fish} files. All field maps were in the T7 format.
Input parameters for the simulations are shown in Table~\ref{simparam}.
Note that on crest refers to the phase of max energy gain.
In the case of the gun, a -~$20^{\circ}$ phase is measured 
w.r.t the phase of max energy gain. 
In other words, we ran $-20^{\circ}$ off crest.
